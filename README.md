# Goals App

[Live Demo](https://jaskarans-goals.vercel.app/)

This is a simple goals management app built with React and TypeScript. The app allows users to add, view, and manage their goals. The goals are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they persist between sessions.

## Features

- Add new goals with a title and description
- View a list of all added goals
- Goals are stored in localStorage to persist between sessions
- Built with TypeScript for type safety
